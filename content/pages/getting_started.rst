What is Beerfactory ?
---------------------

Beerfactory focuses on providing solutions to *monitor, control and manage the homebrewing activity* and consists of two sub-projects :

 * `BrewBox <|filename|/pages/features.rst>`_ : provides software anrd hardware for monitoring and controling the beer production process.
 * `BrewManager <|filename|/pages/features.rst>`_ : a lightweight ERP specialised in homebrewing management.

See details on the `features page <|filename|/pages/features.rst>`_.

Beerfactory is not a beer recipe designer, there are still plenty of good (free) software for this :

 * `Beersmith <http://beersmith.com/>`_
 * `BeerTools <http://www.beertools.com/>`_
 * `JolieBulle <http://joliebulle.tuxfamily.org/>`_
 * ...
