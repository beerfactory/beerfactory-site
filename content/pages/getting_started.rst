What is Beerfactory ?
---------------------

Beerfactory focuses on providing open source solutions for managing home brewing activity. Initially it will consists of two sub-projects :

 * `BrewBox <|filename|/pages/features/brewbox-features.rst>`_ : software and hardware for *monitoring and controling* the beer production process.
 * `BrewManager <|filename|/pages/features/brewbox-features.rst>`_ : a *lightweight ERP* specialised in home brewing management.


What Beerfactory is not ?
-------------------------

Beerfactory is not a beer recipe designer, there are already plenty of good softwares for this :

 * `Beersmith <http://beersmith.com/>`_
 * `BeerTools <http://www.beertools.com/>`_
 * `JolieBulle <http://joliebulle.tuxfamily.org/>`_
 * ...


What's next ?
-------------

BrewBox is in features definition and general architecture analysis. BrewManager will come later. Project activity will be reported on the `blog </category/news.html>`_. Anyone interested in this project is welcome to contribute on the `community forum <http://forum.beerfactory.org>`_.
