What is Beerfactory ?
---------------------

Beerfactory focuses on providing open-source software and hardware solutions for managing home brewing activity. Beerfactory is inspired by `DIY <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself>`_ methods and currently consists of two sub-projects :

* `BrewBox <|filename|/pages/features/brewbox-features.rst>`_ : a set of software and hardware for *monitoring and controling* the beer production process in home brewing.
* `BrewManager <|filename|/pages/features/brewbox-features.rst>`_ : a *lightweight ERP* specialised in home brewing management.

What Beerfactory is not ?
-------------------------

Beerfactory is not a beer recipe designer, there are already plenty of good softwares for this :

* `Beersmith <http://beersmith.com/>`_
* `BeerTools <http://www.beertools.com/>`_
* `JolieBulle <http://joliebulle.tuxfamily.org/>`_
* ...

What's next ?
-------------

The initial goal is to release a first stable version of `BrewBox <|filename|/pages/features/brewbox-features.rst>`_. `BrewManager <|filename|/pages/features/brewbox-features.rst>`_ will come later... Project activity will be reported on the `blog </category/news.html>`_.

Anyone interested in this project is welcome to contribute on the `community forum <http://forum.beerfactory.org>`_ or by looking at the project's source `repositories on Github <https://github.com/beerfactory>`_ .
