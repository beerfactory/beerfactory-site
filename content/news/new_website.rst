:summary: A new version of the project website is now available

Welcome to this new website. You'll find here all informations concerning Beerfactory project.

This website has been made with `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_, a static site generator written in python. Pelican allows to build a completelly static site, ie. made of plain old html files. Content is written in simple `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ files and processed by Pelican using `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ HTML templates. Pelican outputs a complete website structure containing HTML files and static resources like CSS files, javascript and images. It's then easy to upload to a minimal webserver. No more PHP or database needed to run a heavy `CMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system>`_.

For information concerning Pelican and how to use it, HTML templates and `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ source files used for this website are available on the `project's github repository <#>`_.
